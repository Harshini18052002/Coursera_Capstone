This city has a wide area of about 630km2  and a population of about 6,000,000. \nThere are many neighbourhoods in Toronto. In each neighbourhood, there would be sufficient facilities available for the residents. However, when moving, some people may feel uncertain and unwilling to move due to them being comfortable with their current neighbourhoods. This might cause them to feel less willing to move to another neighbourhood.\n\nAim of project:\nThis project aims to showcase the similarities between the neighbourhoods based on the top 10 most common areas in each neighbourhood. Depending on the top 10 most common areas, the people would be able to feel more connected as these areas are available and accessible for those in the neighbourhoods. Hence, this project aims to showcase that these locations are suitable for people with similar facilities in their current neighbourhoods.\n\nTarget Audience:\nThe main target audience of this project is those who are planning of moving to another neighbourhood but are not sure of where to move. This project could also apply to those who might want to move in the future.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "", "execution_count": null, "outputs": []}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.10", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
